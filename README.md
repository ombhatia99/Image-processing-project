# Image-processing-project
This is a project I developed in college during my third year for subject-image processing. In this project I have used tools such as **openCV,frozen east text detection,tesseract OCR and Gtts python library** for image reading, text detection and generating speech Output respectively


there are two python files
ipmv_demo uses **frozen east text detection** for text detectin in an Image
ipmvProject uses **tesseract OCR** to detect text in image and outputs the **.mp3** file of the text in the image
Download tesseract OCR from [this Github link](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Downloads)
